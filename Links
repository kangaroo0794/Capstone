CRISPR/Cas9 can be introduced as DNA plasmid, In Vitro Transcriptions (IVTs) or as Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) format in which the recombinant Cas9 protein is assembled in vitro with chemically synthetized sgRNA or crRNA: tracrRNA duplex. Guide RNAs generated by IVT or chemical synthesis for RNP systems completely bypass the cloning process and allow generation and validation of a CRISPR reagent faster. Also, above formats except RNP can not be applicable in vitro and require to be delivered into cultured cells that involve time-consuming cell culture and transfection steps

Cas9:
Cas9 is an RNA-guided enzyme that cleaves foreign nucleic acids bearing sequences complementary to the RNA loaded into the enzyme during bacterial adaptive immunity.
